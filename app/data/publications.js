        content: [
        "When developing a banking application, teams must comply with countless regulations, directives, and technical requirements.",
        "Amid product managers, architects, developers, testers, and legal advisors, two roles are especially critical: the IT security professional and the UX designer.",
        "But what does real collaboration between UX and IT security actually mean?",
        "[strong]Design: the first line of defense[/strong]",
        "[quote]“If the secure solution is not also the easy, convenient, or practical one, users will find a way to bypass controls for their own comfort or efficiency.”[/quote] — Miklós Zakar, Senior IT Security Expert, BinX Zrt.",

        "Good UX design creates intuitive, seamless interactions that reduce user errors and lower security risks.",
        "However, UX alone cannot prevent fraud if the underlying system is not secure by design.",
        "Security and usability must reinforce each other.",

        "[strong]Mitigate risks[/strong]",
        "Secure usability ensures that security measures are both effective and user-friendly. Overly complex mechanisms, such as unclear password rules or confusing 2FA flows, encourage users to bypass safeguards.",

        "UX designers play a key role in making security features intuitive and accessible. A well-designed interface communicates risks, such as phishing warnings, without causing security fatigue. Clear guidance prevents accidental actions like exposing sensitive data or misconfiguring privacy settings.",

        "Poorly designed interfaces overwhelm users with security options, leading to mistakes or indifference. A strong UX mitigates these risks through clear visual cues, structured workflows, and non-intrusive prompts. Consistency is crucial — familiar patterns help users spot anomalies and suspicious behaviour.",

        "[strong]Joint effort is necessary[/strong]",
        "Security measures must be easy to follow to be effective. If controls are cumbersome, users will find ways around them. At the same time, security elements that do not require user interaction must be fully embedded and unavoidable — beyond UX influence.",

        "User involvement is necessary in specific cases:",
        "1. Passwords — strong setup requirements and secure reset flows.",
        "2. Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA) — combining knowledge, possession, and inherence factors.",
        "3. 3D Secure (3DS) — additional authentication for card payments under PSD2 and SCA requirements.",
        "4. Biometric authentication [/strong] — fingerprints or facial recognition for secure and effortless access.",

        "[quote]“PSD2 introduced Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), making multi-factor authentication mandatory for certain transactions. Over time, 3DS evolved to support richer, more frictionless authentication flows.”[/quote] — Kristóf Belucz, Head of Payment Cards Department, BinX Zrt.",

        "Good UX embeds security into workflows without disrupting efficiency. Clear guidance, intuitive alerts, and secure defaults help users comply naturally. For this to work, IT security and UX must collaborate from the very beginning as core contributors.",

        "[strong]IT security: invisible, but effective[/strong]",
        "Banks manage vast amounts of sensitive data, making them prime targets for fraud and cyberattacks. Strong authentication, encryption, and layered defenses protect data in transit and at rest.",

        "[strong]Secure design principles[/strong]",
        "Security relies on layered protection — defense in depth. UX plays a role where user interaction is required, while other safeguards remain invisible. Key principles include:",
        "- Fail safe defaults — deny access when errors occur.",
        "- Least privilege — users and employees access only what they need.",
        "- Separation of duties — critical actions require multiple approvals.",
        "- Economy of mechanism — simple, understandable security settings.",
        "- Complete mediation — verify every action, not just initial login.",
        "- Open design — security relies on credentials, not obscurity.",
        "- Least common mechanism — minimise shared access paths.",
        "- Psychological acceptability — security must not frustrate users.",
        "- Weakest link awareness — audits and testing remain essential.",
        "- Leverage existing components — use proven security frameworks.",

        "Strong security isn’t about rigid controls alone. It’s about resilience, usability, and real-world effectiveness.",

        "[strong]Teamwork for the win[/strong]",
        "Without IT security involvement, UX designers may overlook critical threats. Collaboration from the start helps designers understand risks and implement effective safeguards.",

        "For example, a quick-transfer feature designed for speed may introduce fraud risk. By collaborating, teams can require biometrics for high-value transfers while keeping small transfers frictionless. This balance protects users without sacrificing usability.",

        "Good UX also reduces support costs. Intuitive security flows lower the need for password resets and account recovery calls. Secure, well-designed aftercare benefits both users and the business.",

        "[strong]Enhance collaboration[/strong]",
        "Effective collaboration between UX and IT security can be fostered through:",
        "- Workshops — sharing knowledge about threats and usability.",
        "- Testing — combining penetration testing with usability testing.",
        "- Design thinking — creating secure solutions that respect human behaviour.",

        "[strong]Conclusion[/strong]",
        "UX design and IT security must work together to create safe digital experiences. Poor UX can encourage risky behaviour, while thoughtful design supports security adherence. However, UX addresses only a subset of security risks — architecture and OS vulnerabilities remain critical.",

        "In banking applications, UX plays a supporting role. Designers advocate for clarity and usability but do not make security-critical decisions. By integrating UX into secure development and fostering strong collaboration, organisations can achieve both robust protection and excellent user experiences. In the end, security is only as strong as its usability.",

          "[strong]Why does neuro-UX matter?[/strong]",
        "Ever found yourself endlessly scrolling through social media or compulsively checking notifications? That’s not a coincidence — it’s design at work, using our brain’s natural shortcuts to keep us engaged. Our brains are wired to make fast decisions, often subconsciously, and this strongly shapes how we interact with digital products.",

        "Designers who understand these shortcuts — known as cognitive biases — can create experiences that feel effortless and even addictive. This is where neuro-UX comes into play.",

        "The term “neuro-UX” refers to user experience design inspired by neuroscience and psychology. It focuses on how our brains process information, make decisions, and form habits. By aligning with instinctive patterns, neuro-UX reduces cognitive load and triggers emotional responses that keep users coming back. For transparency: neuro-UX is not an official scientific term, but a practical umbrella for these ideas.",

        "[strong]The science behind irresistible UX: key principles[/strong]",
        "Neuro-UX leverages psychology to make design smarter and more engaging. Cognitive biases such as fear of missing out (FOMO) or confirmation bias strongly influence online behaviour. To understand frictionless user journeys, let’s pair two powerful concepts: Gestalt principles and Hick’s Law.",

        "[strong]The Law of Similarity (Gestalt principles)[/strong]",
        "[quote]“Gestalt principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex visuals when perceiving objects. Designers use these principles to organize content so interfaces are aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.”[/quote] — Interactive Design Foundation",

        "Gestalt principles help users naturally group elements through proximity, similarity, and structure.",

        "[strong]Hick’s Law[/strong]",
        "[quote]“Hick’s Law states that the more choices users are presented with, the longer it takes them to make a decision. Designers use this principle to evaluate how many options should be offered at any given moment.”[/quote] — Interactive Design Foundation",
        "Hick’s Law reminds us that fewer choices often lead to faster, more confident decisions.",

        "When combined, Gestalt principles and Hick’s Law create experiences that are visually intuitive and decision-efficient. Patterns help users understand structure, while limited options reduce mental effort. Together, they guide users smoothly through complex interfaces.",

        "[strong]Habit-forming design[/strong]",
        "Why do we keep opening our favourite apps? The answer lies in the habit loop: cue, routine, reward. Fitness apps use notifications as cues, actions as routines, and progress or badges as rewards. Social media apps rely on likes and comments to reinforce this loop. Designing with habit formation in mind increases long-term engagement. It turns occasional users into loyal ones.",

        "[strong]KISS: the power of reducing cognitive load[/strong]",
        "In UX design, less is often more. Too many options or too much information overwhelms users and leads to decision paralysis. Designers counter this with progressive disclosure, clear navigation, and strong visual hierarchy.",

        "Netflix is a great example. Instead of showing everything at once, it breaks content into digestible categories. Browsing becomes easy, familiar, and low-effort.",

        "[strong]Emotional triggers: designing for feelings[/strong]",
        "Great design doesn’t just function — it feels. Colours, micro-interactions, and feedback trigger emotional responses. A small animation, like a heart bursting on Instagram, can create joy and satisfaction.",

        "Urgency is another powerful trigger, often used in e-commerce. Messages like “Only 2 items left!” push users toward action. However, this approach can backfire. Pressure can cause frustration, especially when urgency cues feel manipulative or untrue.",

        "[strong]Irresistible UX in practice[/strong]",
        "Spotify’s Discover Weekly is a strong example of neuro-UX in action. Every Monday, users receive a single personalised playlist.",
        "Gestalt principles group similar songs, while Hick’s Law limits choice to one clear option. The result is a simple, enjoyable, and repeatable experience.",

        "Duolingo’s learning path offers another example. Lessons are grouped logically and presented in small chunks. Limited choices keep users focused and reduce overwhelm. This structure supports habit formation and sustained engagement. Side note: some argue that Duolingo’s emotionally charged notifications can be counterproductive. While this debate deserves its own article, research shows these methods work for most users. Those who dislike them usually find alternative learning methods.",

        "[strong]Wrap-up: the future of neuro-UX[/strong]",
        "The future of neuro-UX looks even more promising with AI-driven personalization. As we learn more about the brain, designers gain new tools to craft intuitive experiences.",

        "But with great power comes responsibility. Designers must balance engagement with ethics. Creating addictive products without regard for user wellbeing can cross a dangerous line.",

        "Neuro-UX is not just a trend.",
        "By understanding how the brain works, designers can create experiences that feel natural, intuitive, and genuinely engaging. The future of UX lies in designing products that resonate with users on a deeper, instinctual level.",

        content: [
          "Inclusive design sounds fancy, but it’s much more than accessibility for people with disabilities. True inclusive design creates experiences that work for everyone — whether someone is on a shaky bus, speaks a different language, or faces cognitive challenges. It’s about adaptability across contexts, devices, and situations.",

        "Addressing accessibility debt means prioritising critical issues while setting long-term goals. Preventing it requires integrating accessibility from the very beginning. Inclusive design ensures products are intuitive, usable, and effective for all users.",

        "[strong]From accessibility to true inclusivity[/strong]",
        "Accessibility is the foundation of inclusive design. Alt text, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support are essential — but stopping there misses the bigger picture. Inclusive design considers cognitive differences, cultural backgrounds, internet speeds, devices, and real-life usage scenarios. A truly inclusive product is like a Swiss Army knife — useful in every situation.",

        "[strong]Cognitive differences[/strong]",
        "Designing for cognitive differences is essential for inclusive experiences. A cluttered interface increases cognitive load and harms accessibility. For example, excessive emojis can overwhelm screen readers, disrupting comprehension and usability. Clean, clear content significantly improves the experience.",

        "Consistency helps users know what to expect. Consistent navigation and design patterns reduce cognitive strain. Information architecture principles help structure content and control how much information is revealed. Progressive disclosure is key — too much information at once overwhelms users.",

        "Visual perception also matters. Some users need larger text or higher contrast. Simple layouts, consistent patterns, and customization options like text size or contrast improve satisfaction. Empowered users are more likely to stay.",

        "[strong]Culture matters[/strong]",
        "What feels obvious in one culture may be confusing or offensive in another. Designing for a global audience requires more than translation — it requires cultural understanding.",
        "Gestures, symbols, and colours can carry very different meanings across regions. For example, a thumbs-up gesture may be offensive in parts of the Middle East and Africa.",
        "Colours can also mislead — red signals danger in Western cultures, but prosperity in China.",
        "Cultural research and localization are essential. Without them, organisations risk alienating users and damaging their brand.",
        "Inclusive design must be culturally aware as well as technically accessible.",

        "[strong]Data-driven design[/strong]",
        "Inclusive design starts with research and data. Test products with diverse users across abilities, backgrounds, and cognitive styles. Use analytics to identify friction points for specific groups. Gather feedback through surveys and validate solutions with A/B testing.",

        "[strong]The accessibility debt[/strong]",
        "Accessibility debt is similar to technical debt, but focused on accessibility issues. It builds up when accessibility is neglected during development. Missing alt text, poor contrast, or inadequate navigation accumulate over time. Fixing accessibility debt later is more complex and costly.",

        "Ignoring accessibility excludes over a billion potential users. It increases legal risk, raises costs, and damages brand reputation.",

        "[strong]How accessibility debt grows[/strong]",
        "1. Initial oversights — small omissions seem harmless but accumulate quickly.",
        "2. Compounding issues — each inaccessible feature adds complexity and cost.",
        "3. Integration challenges — fixing issues later often requires redesigning existing systems.",

        "[strong]The impact of accessibility debt",
        "On the product — inaccessible features prevent users with disabilities from using it at all. Retroactive fixes require additional development time and rework.",
        "On user satisfaction — frustration and exclusion damage trust and perception. Users increasingly expect inclusive experiences.",
        "On the company — accessibility is legally required in many regions. Failing to comply can lead to lawsuits and financial penalties. Accessibility is also a market opportunity — excluding users means lost growth.",

        "[strong]Avoid the accessibility debt[/strong]",
        "1. Integrate accessibility from the very start of design and development.",
        "2. Follow established standards such as WCAG.",
        "3. Use automated tools for early detection of issues.",
        "4. Conduct testing with diverse users to uncover real-world problems.",
        "5. Educate teams so accessibility becomes a shared responsibility.",
        "6. Perform regular audits to prevent debt from accumulating.",

        "[strong]Designing for everyone, everywhere[/strong]",
        "Inclusive design goes beyond disability. It accounts for cognitive differences, cultural contexts, and real-life usage. By grounding decisions in research and data, products become intuitive, flexible, and enjoyable. In today’s world, inclusivity is not optional — it’s essential. The more inclusive a product is, the more people can use it — and love it.",

          "Many companies, especially those founded by engineers, initially focus on building a great product. As they grow, however, maintaining organised and scalable information architecture (IA) becomes increasingly challenging. A well-structured IA ensures sustainable growth, user-friendly products, and aligned teams, ultimately enhancing the product, the user experience, and the organisation as a whole.",

          "[strong]The scenario[/strong]",
          "A company founded by engineers created a popular mobile app with innovative features. As the product grew, new functionalities were added organically, resulting in a complex and highly interconnected system. Despite strong user loyalty, frustration emerged due to navigation difficulties, scattered data storage, and organisational misalignment between teams.",

          "[strong]But how can this happen?[/strong]",
          "The application is an IoT management tool that allows users to automate their environment and manually adjust device settings. Initially built for early adopters, it later attracted mainstream users seeking comfort and convenience. As the app evolved organically, little emphasis was placed on logical flows, information architecture, or overall user experience.",

          "[strong]The ripple effect[/strong]",
          "As growth accelerated, leadership introduced UX researchers, data analysts, and product designers. While these experts identified usability issues, management prioritised new features to remain competitive instead of addressing core structural problems. An information architecture audit was initiated only after a prolonged crisis, by which point user dissatisfaction had already grown significantly.",

          "One designer took initiative and mapped the entire application. The audit revealed that many features were accessible from multiple locations, both top-level menus and deep submenus. When questioned, the rationale was flexibility — allowing access from anywhere. What once seemed logical evolved into overwhelming complexity.",

          "The result was an application with intricate cross-connections and dependencies. Developers became hesitant to modify the codebase due to fear of unintended side effects, resembling a butterfly effect. Users, overwhelmed by complexity, began abandoning the product in favour of simpler alternatives.",

          "1. Conduct an IA audit — catalogue all features, data, and user flows; identify pain points; document the current state.",
          "2. Define clear IA goals — prioritise user-centric design, consistency, and scalability.",
          "3. Create a unified IA plan — develop content models, sitemaps, and intuitive navigation paths.",

          "[strong]Introduction",
          "Picture this: engineers are building the software kingdom, and suddenly someone shouts, ‘Wait, where are the design wizards? We need them too!’ Bringing design into the mix later can feel like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole — it rarely works smoothly. What is essential for harmonious collaboration? How does early design involvement benefit engineering, product development, management, and customers?",

          "Many software companies are founded by individuals with deep engineering expertise. These visionaries excel at turning ideas into functional products through hands-on problem solving and technical proficiency. However, as companies grow, relying solely on engineering perspectives can limit long-term success.",
          "A real-world example is Reddit. Founded by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, Reddit initially focused on technical execution and community growth. While functional, the platform’s early interface was difficult to navigate and lacked visual appeal. As Reddit gained popularity, the team recognised that improving user experience through design was essential. By investing in design, Reddit transformed its platform into a more intuitive and engaging experience, contributing to sustained growth and success.",

          "[strong]Design as a complementary function",
          "Designers and engineers form powerful partnerships when building products. Designers contribute insights into user needs, visual clarity, and usability, while engineers ensure technical feasibility. Together, they create products that function well, stand out in the market, and delight users.",
          "Apple’s iPhone is a prime example of this synergy. Led by Jony Ive, Apple’s design team prioritised simplicity, elegance, and user experience. Engineers, under Dan Riccio, translated this vision into a technically advanced yet refined product.",
          "The result was a revolutionary device whose success demonstrated the impact of close collaboration between design and engineering.",

          "[strong]The pitfalls of delayed design integration",
          "As companies grow, management perspective becomes increasingly important. Delaying design integration often leads to usability issues, disengaged users, and costly redesigns. Even products built on brilliant ideas can fail if the user experience is poor. Simply put: bad user experience leads to low Net Promoter Score, customer loss, and reduced revenue. Design should never be viewed as a frivolous cost — it is an investment in retention and satisfaction.",

          "Twitter (pre-X era) illustrates this risk. Initially focused on functionality, Twitter neglected cohesive design. As competition grew, users criticised its cluttered interface and inconsistent experience. A later redesign improved usability, but delayed design integration had already impacted retention and growth.",

          "[strong]Integrating design into the organization",
          "Engineers play a critical role in aligning design with technical feasibility. Their insights help ensure that design decisions support performance and scalability. Involving designers brings benefits such as improved usability, smoother development, enhanced problem-solving, and better developer experience. Clear design documentation and robust design systems accelerate delivery and reduce friction. By collaborating closely, engineers and designers bridge gaps between vision and implementation. Designers gain insight into technical constraints, while engineers benefit from clearer intent and user-centred thinking.",

          "When designers and developers collaborate, it’s like blending strawberries and chocolate — a combination that enhances almost everything. Designers bring creativity, fresh viewpoints, and ideas that transform ordinary projects into digital experiences. Developers contribute technical expertise that brings these ideas to life. Both designers and developers share curiosity, intelligence, and a desire to understand. They are both problem-solvers, but with different focal points. Developers approach challenges through technical feasibility, while designers focus on user pain points.",
          "When these perspectives converge, real magic happens. The result is satisfied users, resolved challenges, and an overall sense of accomplishment. That said, collaboration can be challenging and requires empathy and alignment to build efficient workflows.",

          "A few years ago, we introduced regular design critique sessions. These sessions were open to all stakeholders and anyone interested in participating. The goal was simple: more perspectives lead to better solutions. Initially attended by designers, researchers, and product managers, the sessions gradually attracted developers, sales leaders, support teams, and eventually the CEO. As our ecosystem expanded across mobile, desktop, and hardware products, shared understanding increased across the organization. People became more aware of current work, future plans, and could align their own roadmaps more effectively.",
          "While these sessions may appear resource-intensive, they helped prevent dissatisfaction and future roadblocks. Designers also gained a better understanding of technical and hardware limitations.",

        content: [
        "Imagine a startup consisting of a salesperson, a leader, and a developer. They undertake the development of their application relying exclusively on their own experiences. However, due to budget constraints, they lack the resources for additional research, let alone conducting user testing.",

          "In the rapidly evolving world of software development, the creation and deployment of applications have become an integral part of modern business strategies. Developers often work under tight deadlines and resource constraints, resulting in applications that lack a coherent structure. These unstructured applications can be difficult to navigate and comprehend, leading to user frustration and operational inefficiencies. The solution lies in revamping these applications to enhance usability and coherence.",

          "In this article, we will explore the crucial role of information architecture in transforming unstructured applications.",

          "[strong]Understanding unstructured applications and their challenges[/strong]",
          "Unstructured applications, often referred to as legacy applications, are characterised by a lack of organised design, inconsistent codebases, and limited user-centred approaches. They are typically developed by small teams, individual developers, or startups with constrained resources. While they may fulfil immediate functional requirements, they often suffer from significant usability and coherence issues:",
          "Disjointed user experience — inconsistent design elements, varying interaction patterns, and fragmented workflows make applications difficult to navigate.",
          "Maintenance nightmares — the absence of a coherent structure leads to spaghetti code, tangled dependencies, and poor modularisation, increasing the risk of bugs.",
          "Inefficient collaboration — lack of standardised practices and documentation hampers teamwork, onboarding, and productivity.",

          "[strong]The role of information architecture in revamping[/strong]",
          "At the core of transforming unstructured applications lies a comprehensive overhaul of the information architecture. Information architecture defines the organisation, labelling, and navigation of content within an application. It serves as the blueprint for user interaction, shaping how users access and engage with features. By reimagining this structure, developers can significantly improve usability and coherence.",

          "[strong]Defining a clear hierarchy and navigation[/strong]",
          "The first step in revamping information architecture is defining a clear hierarchy and navigation structure. Categorise functionalities into logical groups, identify primary and secondary features, and prioritise them based on user needs. This hierarchy acts as a roadmap, guiding users intuitively through the application.",

          "[strong]User-centred design principles[/strong]",
          "A user-centred approach is essential in the revamping process. Develop personas and user journeys to understand behaviours and expectations. Use these insights to ensure frequently used features are easy to access and aligned with real user workflows.",

          "[strong]Consistent design patterns[/strong]",
          "Coherence in design is critical to success. Implement consistent design patterns across the application, standardising elements such as buttons, forms, typography, and colour schemes. Consistency reduces cognitive load, improves usability, and enhances visual clarity.",

          "[strong]Simplify and streamline navigation[/strong]",
          "Unstructured applications often suffer from overly complex navigation. Streamline navigation by reducing the number of steps required to reach key features. Use breadcrumbs, dropdowns, and clear calls to action to guide users efficiently.",

          "[strong]Intuitive labelling and information placement[/strong]",
          "Clear labelling and thoughtful information placement help users quickly understand interface elements. Use descriptive labels for menus, buttons, and links. Place information where users naturally expect to find it, following established design conventions.",

          "[strong]Expected positive outcomes[/strong]",
          "After implementing a revamped information architecture, users typically report significant usability improvements. Navigation becomes more intuitive, tasks are completed more efficiently, and user satisfaction increases. Applications often see growth in their user base, supported by positive word-of-mouth.",

DesignOps also fosters relationships between teams, raising awareness of design team goals and methods, and bringing everyone together in a design extravaganza.",

          "[strong]What skills are required?[/strong]",
          "First of all, you need strong self-esteem fueled by extensive research. Knowledge is your weapon, and you'll use it to find the right tools and empower your team members. Once you've armed yourself with knowledge, you'll unleash a wave of benefits for everyone involved. You'll simplify processes, slash task durations, and make everyone's lives easier — a true win-win situation for the design team and all stakeholders.",

          "[strong]What about the long term?[/strong]",
          "DesignOps isn't just about short-term success; it's about long-term strategic vision. You'll define problems and goals before jumping into solutions, like a mastermind detective. As a true superhero, you'll balance continuous evolution with the human need for stability. It's like having one foot in the future and the other in the present — keeping your organisation ahead of the curve while maintaining stability.",

You can see the participants: a product manager, someone from business and a designer. You can't prepare. You feel lost and hope for the best. You enter the video-conferencing channel. The host starts the meeting. After 29.5 minutes of listening, you are sure that this is about a new project. The product manager and the business representative are having a debate about the requirement and the initial idea. You and the designer are listening muted. You have a gut feeling that the designer didn't receive details earlier either. The meeting ends without action points. You feel that your time was wasted. How could all this be done well?

I finished the mockups and handed them over, and the developers were happy. Later, I was invited to a review meeting where a business stakeholder appeared unexpectedly. This meeting turned into a debate about requirements that were never clarified before. After listening for half an hour, I suggested that the PM and business stakeholder align offline and provide a clarified specification asynchronously. They accepted this approach, and we're now waiting for proper input.",
